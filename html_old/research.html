    <h2 class="style1" id="pageName">Research in the Cognitive Area </h2>
    <p>The Cognitive Psychology program at Penn State emphasizes research and theory in   a variety of subareas of cognitive psychology and human performance. All   cognitive students' programs emphasize basic theoretical issues and research   methodologies in cognitive psychology, but individual programs vary widely   depending upon the student's substantive interest. As in the other programs in   the department, the student works with his or her faculty adviser to develop an   individualized program of major and minor areas. Faculty and students in the   cognitive area participate in a weekly &quot;bag lunch&quot; that provides opportunities   to discuss ongoing research projects and issues. Graduates of the program are   prepared to enter research and teaching positions in university or college   settings, or to work in applied research organizations..    </p>

    <h3><a name="vanhell" id="vanhell"></a>Bilingualism and Language Development Laboratory - Website</h3>
    <h3>Director: Janet van Hell</h3>
    <p>The Bilingualism and Language Development (BiLD) Lab studies the cognitive and neurocognitive processes related to language development, second language learning, and bilinguals' use of two languages. We combine behavioral, neuropsychological (ERPs), and linguistic techniques to study patterns of cross-language interaction and transfer in second language learners at different levels of proficiency, as well as neural and cognitive mechanisms involved in language-switching. We also study sign-speech bilinguals who use spatial and oral languages from two different modalities. A second research theme in the BiLD Lab focuses on language development in school-aged children with typical or atypical development, including children with dyslexia or with specific language impairment, and children who are deaf.</p>

    <h3><a name="gilmore" id="gilmore"></a>The Brain Development Lab - <a href="http://brainlab.psych.psu.edu/">Website</a></h3>
    <h3>Director: Rick Gilmore </h3>
    <p>The Brain Development Laboratory in the Psychology Department at Penn State University takes a cognitive neuroscience approach to understanding the development of perception, action, and memory. Our goal is to understand patterns of brain and behavioral changes in infants, children, and young adults. We use behavioral, EEG, and MRI methods in our research.</p>

    <h3><a name="li" id="li"></a>Brain, Language, and Computation Laboratory - <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/pul8/index.shtml">Website</a> </h3>
    <h3>Director: Ping Li</h3>
    <p>In our laboratory we conduct research to understand the relationships among   language, brain, and culture. In particular, our research focuses on the dynamic   changes that occur in the language learner and the dynamic interactions that   occur in the competing language systems over the course of learning. We   investigate the computational and neural mechanisms underlying language   acquisition and representation in both native and non-native speakers of Western   languages (e.g., English) and Asian languages (e.g., Chinese). Our research   identifies common and distinct cognitive and neural processes in language   acquisition and representation. To achieve these goals, we rely on a variety of   convergent behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging methodologies (e.g.,   reaction time studies, artificial neural network models, and functional magnetic   resonance imaging). <br />
      <br />
    Current research projects include the development of self-organizing neural   network models of language acquisition and the study of brain processes   underlying lexical and sentence processing and representation in first and   second languages.</p>

    <h3><a name="dennis" id="dennis"></a>The Cognitive Aging &amp; Neuroimaging (CAN) Lab - <a href="http://canlab.psych.psu.edu/">Website</a> </h3>
    <h3>Director: Nancy Dennis</h3>
    <p>The Cognitive Aging & Neuroimaging (CAN) Lab, in the Department of Psychology at Penn State, examines the effects of aging on learning and memory processes using both behavioral and functional  neuroimaging (fMRI) methods. Our lab focuses on several cognitive processes associate with learning and memory including the study of  true memories, false memories, relational memories, implicit learning and cognitive control of both remembering and forgetting. With respect to cognitive aging, our research concentrates on the examination of age-related neural markers of cognitive decline, as well as mechanisms for neural compensation.</p>

    <h3><a name="carlson" id="carlson"></a>Cognitive Skill Acquisition Lab</h3>
    <h3>Director: Richard Carlson</h3>
    <p>As individuals acquire cognitive skills, not only does their performance   improve, but the nature of the control processes guiding performance and of the   accompanying metacognition change.&nbsp;&nbsp; Control comes to rely more on environmental   regularities, and errors in fluent performance may be difficult to detect.&nbsp; For   example, individuals count more fluently when the events to be counted occur at   regular intervals, but they have more difficulty detecting counting errors.&nbsp; In   our lab we study these phenomena using behavioral methods and cognitive tasks   ranging from counting to rule use to spatial cognition.&nbsp; Current research   projects focus on the acquisition of anticipatory timing in acquiring   information, on the representation of control processes, on the role of   embodiment in control (e.g., pointing while counting), and on the role of   momentary emotion in cognitive control.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><a name="weiss" id="weiss"></a>The Comparative Communication Laboratory </h3>
    <h3>Director: Dan Weiss</h3>
    <p>One of the longstanding questions in the study of language is why humans are the only species on the planet capable of its acquisition. One of the main goals of the Comparative Communication Laboratory is the study of the mechanisms underlying language acquisition.   These include statistical learning mechanisms that have been implicated in the early acquisition of phonetic categories and word boundaries, rule learning, and generalization of learning. Our approach compares the performance of human infants and adults, as well as nonhuman primates (hereafter primates) on a variety of behavioral tasks in order to identify the underlying similarities and differences both between species and within humans across stages of development. In addition, we are interested in studying select topics pertaining to cognition and conspecific communication in primates. See the links below for more details.</p>

    <h3>Director: Frederick Brown </h3>
    <p>My laboratory studies the genetically  determined circadian-rhythm feature of&nbsp; human  morningness/ eveningness time preferences for daily activity. We measure these  preferences on changes in daily alertness and cognitive functioning, as well as  on the internal sense of time, both when rested and sleep deprived. We survey  these preferences using the Basic Language Morning Scale, developed in my  laboratory. These preferences relate directly to changes across the day in intellectual  functioning, driving behavior, and athletic performance. Also, time perception  changes are being measured using high-density EEG recordings.&nbsp;A second  area of laboratory research investigates sleep-disruption effects on wellbeing for  older adults. We survey different populations of older persons using the Sleep  Disruption Survey, also developed in my laboratory. That research is to develop  strategies or intervention techniques to improve good sleeping for better  over-all health. </p>

    <h3>Director: David Rosenbaum</h3>
    <p>The Laboratory for Cognition and Action is one of the only labs in the world concerned with the cognitive psychology of physical action control. We use behavioral and computational methods, informed by neuroscience, medicine, kinesiology, and robotics, to explore the means by which people (and animals) plan and control body movements. We are especially interested in tasks requiring reaching and grasping of objects and in tasks requiring walking. Our work has implications for skill training, physical therapy, safety engineering, and robotics.</p>
