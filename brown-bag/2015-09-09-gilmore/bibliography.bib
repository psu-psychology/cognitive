	abstract = {The present research investigates neonatal sensitivity to optic flow. Twenty five 3-day-old infants were placed inside a dark room and observed while presented with a 10 s bilateral and backward peripheral optic motion. Seven constant flow velocity conditions were used (2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0 and 30.0 degrees per second) and were compared to a baseline motionless condition. Sagittal deviation of the head was computer-sampled at 60 Hz frequency with pressure transducers. As indicated by the mean head pressure during optic flow exposure, infants reacted with backward leaning of the head whose magnitude was linearly related to the optic flow velocity. Additionally, isolated head postural responses were identified. The magnitude of these responses was clearly related to the optic flow velocity.},

	abstract = {Motion cues provide a rich source of information about translations of the observer through the environment as well as the movements of objects and surfaces. While the direction of motion can be extracted locally these local measurements are, in general, insufficient for determining object and surface motions. To study the development of local and global motion processing mechanisms, we recorded Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) in response to dynamic random dot displays that alternated between coherent rotational motion and random motion at 0.8\&\#xa0;Hz. We compared the spatio-temporal tuning of the evoked response in 4–6\&\#xa0;months old infants to that of adults by recording over a range of dot displacements and temporal update rates. Responses recorded at the frequency of the coherent motion modulation were tuned for displacement at the occipital midline in both adults in infants. Responses at lateral electrodes were tuned for speed in adults, but not in infants. Infant responses were maximal at a larger range of spatial displacement than that of adults. In contrast, responses recorded at the dot-update rate showed a more similar parametric displacement tuning and scalp topography in infants and adults. Taken together, our results suggest that while local motion processing is relatively mature at 4–6\&\#xa0;months, global integration mechanisms exhibit significant immaturities at this age.},

	abstract = {Humans discriminate approaching objects from receding ones shortly after birth, and optic flow associated with self-motion may activate distinctive brain networks, including the human MT+ complex. We sought evidence for evoked brain activity that distinguished radial motion from other optic flow patterns, such as translation or rotation by recording steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), in both adults and 4–6 month-old infants to direction-reversing optic flow patterns. In adults, radial flow evoked distinctive brain responses in both the time and frequency domains. Differences between expansion\&sol;contraction and both translation and rotation were especially strong in lateral channels (PO7 and PO8), and there was an asymmetry between responses to expansion and contraction. In contrast, infants\&apos; evoked response waveforms to all flow types were equivalent, and showed no evidence of the expansion\&sol;contraction asymmetry. Infants\&apos; responses were largest and most reliable for the translation patterns in which all dots moved in the same direction. This pattern of response is consistent with an account in which motion processing systems detecting locally uniform motion develop earlier than do systems specializing in complex, globally non-uniform patterns of motion, and with evidence suggesting that motion processing undergoes prolonged postnatal development.},

	abstract = {The development of spatial vision is relatively well documented in human and nonhuman primates. However, little is known about the development of sensitivity to motion. We measured the development of sensitivity to direction of motion, and the relationship between motion and contrast sensitivity in macaque monkeys as a function of age. Monkeys (Macaca nemestrina, aged between 10 days and 3 years) discriminated direction of motion in random-dot kinematograms. The youngest monkeys showed directionally selective orienting and the ability to integrate motion signals at large dot displacements and fast speeds. With age, coherence sensitivity improved for all spatial and temporal dot displacements tested. The temporal interval between the dots was far less important than the spatial offset in determining the animals' performance at all but the youngest ages. Motion sensitivity improved well beyond the end of the first postnatal year, when mid-spatial-frequency contrast sensitivity reached asymptote, and continued for at least 3 years. Sensitivity to contrast at high spatial frequencies also continued to develop beyond the end of the first year. We conclude that the development of motion sensitivity depends on mechanisms beyond the low-level filters presumed to limit acuity and contrast sensitivity, and most likely reflects the function of extrastriate visual areas.},

	abstract = {Motion provides animals with fast and robust cues for navigation and object detection. In the first case, stereotyped patterns of optic flow inform a moving observer about the direction and speed of its own movement. In the case of object detection, regional differences in motion allow for the segmentation of figures from their background, even in the absence of color or shading cues. Previous research has investigated human electrophysiological responses to global motion across speeds, but only focused upon one type of optic flow pattern. Here, we compared steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses across patterns and speeds, both for optic flow and for motion-defined figure patterns, to assess the extent to which the processes are pattern-general or pattern-specific. For optic flow, pattern and speed effects on response amplitudes varied substantially across channels, suggesting pattern-specific processing at slow speeds and pattern-general activity at fast speeds. Responses for coherence- and direction-defined figures were comparatively more uniform, with similar response profiles and spatial distributions. Self- and object-motion patterns activate some of the same circuits, but these data suggest differential sensitivity: not only across the two classes of motion, but also across the patterns within each class, and across speeds. Thus, the results demonstrate that cortical processing of global motion is complex and activates a distributed network.},
