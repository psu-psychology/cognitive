    <p>For many years I have investigated the rhythms that underlie  human behavior, including daily (circadian and sleep/wake cycles), monthly  (lunar cycle and reproduction), and seasonal rhythms (births and sudden infant-death  syndrome). I co-edited the book, Rhythmic Aspects of Behavior, with R. C.  Graeber, COL (NASA Ret.) for the fledgling field of chronobehavior. My major concentration  is on the genetically determined morningness/ eveningness predispositions for  daily activity cycles. I have published a Basic Language Morningness (BALM)  Scale which is used world-wide to self-rate these morningness/eveningness  preferences, and also have developed a Spanish language version. My students  and I measure the effect of these preferences on daily alertness and cognition,  as well as on the internal sense of time. They relate directly to changes across  the day in activities such as driving and athletic performance. A second area  of my research focuses on sleep changes with maturity. A currently supported  collaborative project with colleagues from the School of Engineering and  Hershey Medical Center investigates sleep-disruption effects on the wellbeing  of older adults. This project in particular relates to my applied teaching  emphasis on wellness psychology and the textbook that I am co-authoring on this topic.</p>

    <p> My research focus is on the conscious control of skilled mental activity, and   how control and experience change with increasing skill. This research is guided   by a theory of consciousness described in my book <U>Experienced Cognition</U> (1997). My students and I study the fine-grained structure of deliberate control   in complex tasks such as symbolic and spatial problem solving and reasoning. We   are currently developing a model of the time course of deliberate control,   tracing the evolution of goal representations in stages: plan, intention,   procedure, outcome representation. These stages occur at each step of complex   mental activity, on a time scale of a second or so. The model emphasizes the   importance of processes for coordination, placekeeping, and monitoring. </p>
<p>Recent empirical work emphasizes the roles of temporal synchronization and   externalizing strategies (such as pointing while counting) in achieving   deliberate control of fluent mental activities. Our college-student participants   find tasks such as counting on-screen events and performing running arithmetic   quite challenging, despite the highly-skilled nature of the component skills for   these tasks. Such tasks therefore provide rich paradigms for understanding   control, and for developing a theory of deliberate control.</p>

    <p>My research focuses on elucidating the cognitive and neural mechanisms that support learning and memory in young and older adults. I employ both behavioral and neuroimaging methods, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI) to explore the interaction of cognitive and neural processes involved in episodic memory. My research investigates the neural correlates of episodic memory during both encoding and retrieval, focusing on the neural processes associated with relational memory and false memory. Other areas of research in my lab focus on implicit learning and cognitive control of memories. With respect to cognitive aging, my research concentrates on the examination of age-related neural markers of cognitive decline, as well as mechanisms for neural compensation.  </p>

    <p>My research takes a cognitive neuroscience approach to the development of   perception, action, learning, and memory in infancy and early childhood. There   are several broad themes to my current research. One focuses on the development of   spatial perception - specifically the perception of self-and object motion from optic flow   - and the relationship of optic flow perception to locomotion. Another focuses on the processing of symmetry. I am also interested in  quantitative   techniques for studying individual differences in habituation, a form of simple   learning. </p>

    <p>Judith Kroll is Distinguished Professor of Psychology, Linguistics, and Women's Studies and Director of the Center for Language Science at Pennsylvania State University (<a href="http://www.cls.psu.edu">http://www.cls.psu.edu</a>). She completed her undergraduate work at New York University and her graduate work at Brandeis University. She previously held faculty positions at Mount Holyoke College, Rutgers University, and Swarthmore College. Together with Annette de Groot, she co-edited Tutorials in Bilingualism: Psycholinguistic Perspectives (1997, Erlbaum) and the Handbook of Bilingualism: Psycholinguistic Approaches (2005, Oxford). She served as a co-editor of Bilingualism: Language and Cognition from its founding in 1997 until 2001 and its coordinating editor from 2001-2002. She serves on a number of editorial boards, including Journal of Memory and Language, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, International Journal of Bilingualism, Journal of Cognitive Psychology, and Psychological Science. The research that she and her students conduct concerns the acquisition, comprehension, and production of two languages during second language learning and in proficient bilingual performance. Their work, using behavioral and neurocognitive methods, is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.  She is the PI on a recently awarded PIRE grant from NSF (Partnerships for International Research and Education) to develop an international research network and program of training to enable Penn State students at all levels (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral) and early career faculty to  pursue research abroad on the science of bilingualism (<a href="http://www.cls.psu.edu/pire">http://www.cls.psu.edu/pire</a>).  She was one of the founding organizers of Women in Cognitive Science, a group developed to promote the advancement of women in the cognitive sciences and supported by the National Science Foundation (<a href="http://www.albany.edu/~lf503/wics/">http://www.albany.edu/~lf503/wics/</a>).</p>

    <p>My research examines the computational and neural processes that underlie the   acquisition and representation of monolingual (native) and bilingual (native and   non-native) languages. It focuses on the dynamic changes that occur in the   language learner and the dynamic interactions that occur in the competing   language systems over the course of learning. In particular, our research   attempts to identify the computational mechanisms and the neural structures that   characterize the interactive dynamics underlying the learning of one or multiple   lexical systems (e.g., words acquired early by children and by Chinese-English   bilinguals). Researchers in my lab use self-organizing neural networks to   simulate lexical development, and use ERP and fMRI methods to investigate the   neural mechanisms that subserve lexical organization and competition in the   monolingual and the bilingual brain. </p>

      Assistant Professor of Psychology </h2>
    <p>My core interests lie in understanding how children form representations of the visual world and how emerging functional specificity of the developing brain supports this process.  Specifically, I am interested in the developmental trajectory of face representations because the discrimination and recognition of faces is one of the most taxing perceptual challenges confronted by people in their day-to-day life.  Also, faces are the pre-eminent social signal, therefore, studying developmental changes in the behavioral and brain basis of face processing in typically developing individuals and in those affected by social-emotional disorders may index a core set of developmental changes within the broader social information processing system. </p>
    <p>My approach allows me to address some of the most pressing questions about how developmental changes in brain function and structure support changes in behavior.  I employ converging methodologies, including functional and structural magnetic resonance, and diffusion tensor imaging along with detailed behavioral paradigms in both typically developing populations and those with developmental disorders, with particular emphasis on autism, to examine development across multiple time points from early childhood to adulthood.  My goals are to 1) understand the mechanisms by which these representations change developmentally, particularly during adolescence when pubertal maturation has a profound influence of the re-organization of neural circuits and the processing of social information, 2) understand how cortex develops the capacity to represent and compute face representations that support multiple aspects of face processing, including face identification, categorization, and, in the future, the process of garnering social attributions from faces, 3) elucidate the consequences when psychological or neural processes deviate from the normal trajectory, and 4) develop intervention paradigms that may alter abnormal developmental trajectories in both the behavioral and neural aspects of face processing.</p>

    <p>I am  interested in the cognitive and neural processes related to language  development and language use. There are two broad themes to my current  research. One focuses on cognitive and neural processes that enable the  learning and use of multiple languages in bilinguals at different levels of  proficiency. My students and I study developmental patterns of cross-language  interaction and transfer related to lexical and morpho-syntactic processing, as  well as neural and cognitive mechanisms involved in language-switching. We also  study sign-speech bilinguals who use spatial and oral languages from two  different modalities. The second research theme focuses on language development  in school-aged children with typical or atypical development (including  children with dyslexia or with specific language impairment, children who are  deaf, and bilingual children from an ethnic minority background). </p>

    <p>Daniel Weiss is a comparative psychologist, investigating the cognitive abilities of infant and adult humans, as well as non-human
      primates. One of his primary lines of research explores the cognitive
      mechanisms underlying language acquisition. This work focuses on 
      statistical learning mechanisms that have been implicated in the 
      learning of phonetic categories, word segmentation and other aspects 
      of language. Some of his recent work has focused on how learners are 
      able to cope with multiple input streams and what triggers learners to combine across streams.  Another line of research focuses on animal 
      cognition. This work has recently focused on topics such as motor 
      planning and in-group/out-group formation. A planned line of research 
      with children and nonhuman primates will focus on the cognitive<br />
      abilities underlying hiding.<br />

    <p>My research program takes a cross-disciplinary approach to bilingual language processing using converging methodological tools from linguistics, experimental psycholinguistics, and second language acquisition. The primary focus of my research concerns bilingual sentence processing. The students in my lab and I examine whether language-specific information is largely kept independent when bilinguals compute or parse an initial syntactic structure for the sentences they read, or whether information from one language influences parsing decisions in the other language. <br />
    </p>
<p>In addition, because of our interest in cognitive aspects of bilingualism and in language contact phenomena, we have conducted a series of studies on code-switching. Proficient bilinguals often code-switch in the midst of speaking with other bilinguals and the linguistic principles that govern the observed switches have been a focus of debate. Although code switching performance has been analyzed primarily from the perspective of bilingual speakers, there are critical consequences for comprehension because unlike production, which is under the control of the speaker, comprehension is unpredictable. To investigate the relationship that exists between the frequency of occurrence of code-switches in naturalistic data (i.e., production data) and the ease with which the comprehension mechanism processes these code-switches, we use eye-tracking methods to examine the reading of code-switched sentences as well as the comprehension of spoken code-switches.</p>
